Assignment 5 â€“ Broadcasting and Vectorized Operations

Given:
- A 1D array of shape (3,)

Perform:
- Element-wise multiplication using broadcasting
- Row-wise addition of the 1D array to the 2D array
- Column-wise subtraction of a 1D array from the 2D array (hint: use `.T` or reshape)

Requirements:
- Do not use explicit loops
- Use broadcasting only
